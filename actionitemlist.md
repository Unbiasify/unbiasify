Do we want our names in the dropdown to link to specific site? If so, when I tried to do basic URL link it didn't work... - Martin


LINKEDIN IMPROVEMENTS
-notice that chrome doesn't remember the setting from when I last used Unbiasify. i.e. if I close chrome and open chrome again, I have to re-toggle.
-https://www.linkedin.com/messaging is buggy, some names show, others don't



NICE TO HAVES
-Master toggle switch turn all names and/or all photos off
-Other sourcing tools
-Diversity and Inclusion links, resources
-D and I newsfeed?
-Link to a list of top D and I advocates to follow on Twitter/etc
-Email templates you can inject into
